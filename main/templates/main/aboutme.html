  Hello there! Im Junior Python Developer
</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">
  I am interested in a wide variety of IT related subjects â€“ from internal
algorithms to technologies and devices for everyday use. I enjoy advancing
my Python skills and working with the Linux terminal in my free time. In
addition, I know how to communicate with different people as I am usually
able to find the right approach to any person in my workplace. I believe that a
good conversation can be a key to resolving many problems in work
processes and any general life situations. It is easy for me to both work in a
team and complete projects on my own. I consider myself a responsible
person and I know how to finish tasks successfully and achieve goals on time.
